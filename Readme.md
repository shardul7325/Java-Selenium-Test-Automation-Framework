
# Java-Selenium Test Automation Framework

This is a Java-Selenium based Test Automation Framework designed for scalability, maintainability, and ease of use.

It supports data-driven testing, cloud execution via LambdaTest, headless browser testing, and generates detailed reports and logs.


## üöÄ About Me
Hi, my name is Shardul Pakhare and I have more than 3 years of experience in Automation Testing using technologies like Selenium WebDriver and Rest Assured.

My major expertise is in Java programming language and automating desktop web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before  running this framework, ensure the following software is installed on your system:

- **Java 11** - Make sure Java 11 is installed and the JAVA_HOME variable is set.
- **Maven** - Ensure maven is installed and added to the system path.
    Download link - https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
- **Git** (if cloning from repo)
- **IDE** like IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse (optional)

## üß™ Test Data Support
This framework supports data-driven testing via:

- CSV files (using OpenCSV)
- Excel files (using Apache POI)
- JSON files (using Gson)

Test data is stored in the testData/ directory.

## üåê LambdaTest Integration
If you choose to run tests on LambdaTest (isLambdaTest=true), make sure your credentials are set correctly. You can manage these via environment variables or a config file.

You will need:
- LambdaTest Username
- LambdaTest Access Key

These are typically passed or stored securely and injected at runtime.

## üìä Reports and Logs
**ExtentReports** - Test execution results are generated in HTML format.
- Output: ./extent-reports/report.html

**Log4j Logs** - Logs for each test run are saved in the logs/ directory.
- Output: ./logs/automation.log

These provide detailed insights into test execution and can be used for debugging and validation.

## üîß Additional Features
- **Headless Mode Support** - Run tests without opening the browser UI.

- **Fake Data Generation** - Use Faker to generate dynamic test data on the fly.

- **Parameterized Execution** - Easily control execution flow using Maven CLI parameters.

## Setup Instructions

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shardul7325/Java-Selenium-Test-Automation-Framework.git

    cd Java-Selenium-Test-Automation-Framework
```

## üöÄ How to Run Tests
**Run via Maven (Command Line)**

```bash
    mvn test -X -Dbrowser=<browser> -DisLambdaTest=<true|false> -DisHeadless=<true|false>
```

Parameters:
- browser: Name of the browser to run tests on. (e.g., chrome, firefox)

- isLambdaTest: Set to true to run tests on LambdaTest cloud, false to run locally.

- isHeadless: Set to true to run tests in headless mode for faster execution.

Example:
```bash
    mvn test -X -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true
```

## Integrated the project with Github Actions
This automation framework is integrated with github Actions.
The tests will be executed at 23:30 IST every single day.

The reports will be archived in gh-pages branch.
